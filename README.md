### Hi I'm Erika Nesse ðŸ‘‹

I've spent 7 years as a programmer analyst and full stack developer for [Abt Associates](https://www.abtassociates.com/). I have been taking a sabbatical to learn about machine learning, including two batches at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I implemented a [transformer model from scratch](https://github.com/erika-n/transformers_from_scratch) and created a [compression tool](https://github.com/erika-n/GPTzip) based off the [LLMZip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04050) paper, among other fun and [creative](https://creativecoding.recurse.com/#sketch_18) coding projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [GPTZip](https://github.com/erika-n/GPTzip), a compression tool using GPT-2
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning with pytorch, and working through cryptopals to learn cryptography
